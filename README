# Twitch Idle Game

A simple process to run for twitch streams.  Every chatter contributes to fun world accumulations.

The process runs as basic as can be, recording all state in browser storage.
It is designed to be activated as custom browser docks within OBS, without needing a server for any hosting.

Note, when using it within OBS, you must use `file://` paths for both the dock and browser source, so that localstorage may be shard between the elements.  When creating a custom browser source, do not check the Local File box, as that will run the file on a different "host"

## game.html

This is the central logic file.  It listens to twitch chat to register users into the game world, as well as responds to chat commands.
It's important to always have this running in the background for the game to execute its loop.

## overlay.html

On-screen graphics for OBS to show the current state of the game.
Namely, it shows notifications, world totals, and combat.

## dashboard.html

Comprehensive view of the game's current state.
Use this to view everyone's individual status.

## secrets.js

Twitch credential configuration goes here.  These settings are only required if you wish to have a bot that responds to chat commands.
Certain commands can be triggered by claiming rewards that cost channel points instead.

The contents should look like

```
window.secrets = {
    credentials: {
        twitch: {
            username: '<twitch-bot-name>',
            clientId: '<twitch-app-id>',
            clientSecret: '<twitch-app-secret>',
            accessToken: '<accessToken>',
            refreshToken: '<refreshToken>'
        }
    }
};
```
